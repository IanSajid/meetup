The goal of this demo is to provide a an intro to creating heat maps with R. Specific examples include 2-D histograms, and tiled heat maps, which are used to visualize clustered data matrices. These tools are intended to provide simple solutions for visualizing dense, high-dimensional data. An emphasis is placed on selecting effective color palettes (the Brewer color palettes), which are accessed through the **RColorBrewer** package.

This demo assumes some knowledge the **dplyr** (see the kickoff Meetup, /2014-09-08-kickoff-meetup-dplyr-demo) and **ggplot2** packages. In particular, the **magrittr** pipe, `%>%` (loaded with **dplyr**), is used extensively. Tiled heat maps are generated with the `heatmap.2()` and `aheatmap()` functions, which are included in the **gplots** and **NMF** packages, respectively.

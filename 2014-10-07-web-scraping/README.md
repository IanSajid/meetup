These web scraping examples were presented at the October 2014 Meetup by Clay Ford. The intent of the talk was to simply present two possible ways of web scraping data. There is no one correct way to do it. But hopefully these examples gave attendees some ideas about how they might accomplish their own web scraping tasks. 

In the first example we scrape a single web page: the IMDB top 250 movies. In the second example we scrape multiple web pages: the collectibles listings on the Charlottesville Craigslist site. 

The R script is heavily commented and should lend itself to individual study and investigation. Packages used include **stringr**, **XML**, **lubridate** and **dplyr**.
